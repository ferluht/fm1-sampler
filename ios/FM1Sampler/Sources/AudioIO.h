// AudioIO: the iOS counterpart of the Oboe streams of native-lib.cpp. One RemoteIO unit, 44.1 kHz float on the client side (iOS converts when
// the hardware runs at another rate; the FM-1's USB audio runs at 44.1 kHz, so through it nothing is converted). Output goes wherever iOS routes
// it (the FM-1 when it is plugged in, otherwise the speaker / headphones); the input is the phone's own microphone, never the USB device.
